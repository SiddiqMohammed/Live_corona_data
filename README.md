# Live corona data


The aim of this website is to show the current data regarding COVID-19.  In addition to that, it also represents the values visually so that with just a glance a person would be able to get a picture of the current situation.

I wrote a custom python script to get the data from multiple sources and then uploaded them to a database from which the website then retrieves the data. 
I plan to keep updating the website to have more graphs and interactivity in the future.

The project was inspired by the Coronavirus Outbreak Map by John Hopkins University.
